Embedded Spell calculator idea

Basic Structure:

Stored with each spell will be four data fields stored in the spell definition or template objects:
	- Default to ask for discipline, overpower,
	- DONE spell specific variables
	- form order
		- DONE Data-element : Label
		- Requests default data values that have been stored in lastAnswer objects.
	- DONE Report structure
	- DONE calculationObject
		- A string calculated as an EVAL.      new Function(str))() will call the data defined in the string http://moduscreate.com/javascript-performance-tips-tricks/




Phase two:
	- Storing prefences.
		- Create a lastAnswer setting for every spell. Default those values any time that page is loaded.
		- Allow for a user to update every stored discipline rank

Each field will hold a JSON object holding the values.  The JSON objects will be loaded on any screen that uses that data.
