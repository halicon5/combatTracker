Combat Tracker

Basic Structure:

Allow a GM to track multiple combatants initiatives, offensive penalties, defensive penalties, and health

- Add combatants
- Track status
- Keep a historical log
- Keep a summary of health and next action
- Provide a chart of all combatants
- Provide a pop-up of the main details
- Allow editing of the past events


Flow:

- Add combatant templates, if desired.
	- Eventually allow imports of combatants from previous engagements
- Create an engagement
- Assign combatants or create combatants
	- Creating a combatant will create an independent record tied only to that engagement.
	- Set initiative
	- Create an summary entry for each combatant
	- Create a combat timeline for each combatant
- Start Combat
	- Cycle through each combatant, identifying lowest initiative as first tick.

COMBAT CYCLE:
	- OFFLINE ACTION: Resolve current combatant action
	- Increment any defense and offense action counters or resolve if refocused.
	- Update any injuries
		- If a combatant is injured, indicate if interruped
	- OFFLINE ACTION: Receive next declared action
	- Input duration of the next declared action
	- REPEAT FOR ALL CURRENT TICK COMBATANTS

	- Increment current counter
	- Resort or highlight current combatants.
	
	- Allow insert of new combatant on current tick. Do not use initiative, instead indicating starting tick position
		- Create summary entry
		- Create combat timeline
